            <p>So, my name's Jasmin, but you probably already knew that, seeing as I would never willingly show this to anyone outside my software class. 
                You can pry this embarrassing, ugly website out of my cold, dead hands. 
                Few things you need to know; Cats and snakes are my favourite animal by far, and when I eventually get a pet snake It's gonna be tiny and its gonna be named Jormungandr, Jormy for short. 
                I actually do have a pet cat named Basil, in which I will now take the chance to release all my pictures of him into the wilds of this ugly website.

            <p>I'm very, very lazy, and sleep is something I spend about 90% of my time doing when I'm not doing nothing. 
                As a hobby, I would rate it 8/10, because I can never do it as long as I want to.</p>
